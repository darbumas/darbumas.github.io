## Resume

### Summary

I am in software engineering, specializing in low-level programming and simulation. With a proven track record of contributing to web and mobile application development, I bring a commanding proficiency in C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL. My commitment to agile methodologies has facilitated rapid product deployment, showcasing not only technical acumen but also effective team cohesion.

### Skills

* *Languages*: C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, SQL
* *Frameworks*: Ruby-on-Rails, React, Node.js, Express.js, Flask, Sinatra
* *Database*: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite
* *Dev Tools*: Linux, MacOS, Vagrant, Git, Github-Actions, Vim, VS Code, Heroku, AWS, Docker, Travis CI, Slack, Microsoft Office, Google Suite, Adobe Creative Suite

### Projects

1. Medication Management System (November 2023 - Ongoing)
	* Developed a medication management system that streamlines medication
	  administration, tracking, and reporting processes while ensuring
	  compliance with industry regulations.
	* Backend: Ruby-on-Rails for development, FHIR server (Simplifier) for
	  rapid prototyping, SQLite to store data.
	* Frontend: React, React Native.
	* Integration and messaging:HL7 messaging standards for exchanging
	  medication data.
	* Deployment and Hosting: GitHub Actions, Heroku (PaaS).

2. Industrial Automation Controller Update (June 2023)
	* Developed and implemented real-time operational programs to optimize
	  controller functionality using C.
	* Coordinated seamless communication between controllers and peripheral
	  devices via industry-standard protocols such as Modbus.
	* Implemented low-level techniques (object pooling, buddy allocation, ect.)
	  to optimize memory allocation and deallocation patterns to reduce
	  fragmentation, improve caching and minimize page faults.
	* Simplified program flow and reduced execution time leveraging techniques
	  such as copy propagation, constant folding and dead store elimination to 
	  identify and eliminate redundant computations.

3. Advanced Shell Implementation
	* Designed and built an advanced command shell program in C that parses
	  input commands, handles I/O redirection and piping between processes,
	  and manages background processes and proper process termination
	* Implemented system calls like fork(), exec(), wait(), and pipe() to spawn
	  processes, redirect I/O, and establish inter-process pipes for communication.
	* Employed signal handling with sigaction() to ensure background processes
	* can be automatically cleaned up.
